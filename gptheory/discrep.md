Got it. Since `job_titles` are part of your `employees` table and there's no separate reference table, you'll need to handle discrepancies directly within your current schema. 

Here's how you can approach finding and correcting discrepancies with the existing schema:

### 1. **Identify Discrepancies**

To identify discrepancies where job titles do not match the department, you can use queries to compare the current data with your known valid job titles and departments. Since there’s no reference table, you need to rely on your current schema and known valid values.

#### **Find Employees with Incorrect Departments**

If you have a list of job titles and their expected departments (possibly hardcoded or predefined), you can manually check for discrepancies:

```sql
-- Assuming you have a predefined mapping of job titles to departments
-- For example, Engineers should be in the Engineering department
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.job_title, e.department_id, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
    (e.job_title = 'Engineer' AND d.department_name != 'Engineering')
    OR
    (e.job_title = 'Manager' AND d.department_name != 'Management')
    -- Add more conditions as needed for other job titles
;
```

You can adjust this query to match the specific job titles and their expected departments.

### 2. **Update Incorrect Records**

Once you’ve identified discrepancies, you can correct them by updating the `department_id` for the affected employees. Here’s how you might do it:

#### **Update Department Based on Job Title**

If you need to correct the department based on the job title, you can use a series of update queries:

```sql
-- Update department for Engineers to Engineering
UPDATE employees
SET department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
)
WHERE job_title = 'Engineer'
AND department_id != (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
);

-- Similarly, update other job titles as needed
```

#### **Batch Updates for Multiple Titles**

If you have multiple job titles that need to be corrected, you can use a case-based approach:

```sql
-- Update employees based on job title with case-specific department updates
UPDATE employees
SET department_id = CASE 
    WHEN job_title = 'Engineer' THEN (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM departments
        WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
    )
    WHEN job_title = 'Manager' THEN (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM departments
        WHERE department_name = 'Management'
    )
    -- Add more cases as needed
    ELSE department_id -- Keep the existing department if no condition matches
END
WHERE job_title IN ('Engineer', 'Manager', 'Salesperson', 'Marketer', 'Accountant');
```

### 3. **Automation and Validation**

To prevent such discrepancies in the future:

1. **Implement Validation Rules**: Ensure that any new data inserted or updated in the `employees` table adheres to expected constraints. This could involve application-level validation checks.

2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically run queries to check for discrepancies between job titles and departments to catch issues early.

3. **Consider Future Enhancements**: In the long term, having a reference table for job titles and their corresponding departments could simplify management and validation. You could also create triggers or additional constraints to enforce data integrity.

### Summary

- **Identify Discrepancies**: Use queries to find mismatches between job titles and departments.
- **Update Records**: Correct the department information for employees with incorrect job titles.
- **Prevent Future Issues**: Implement validation rules and consider adding a reference table for job titles and departments in the future.


# Breakdown of the query

Certainly! Let's break down the SQL query step by step. This query is used to update records in the `employees` table to correct the `department_id` for employees whose job title is 'Engineer' but who are currently in the wrong department.

### SQL Query Breakdown

```sql
-- Update department for Engineers to Engineering
UPDATE employees
SET department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
)
WHERE job_title = 'Engineer'
AND department_id != (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'
);
```

#### 1. **`UPDATE employees`**

This specifies that we are updating the `employees` table.

#### 2. **`SET department_id = (`**

This line begins the process of setting a new value for the `department_id` column in the `employees` table. The new value will be determined by a subquery that follows.

#### 3. **`SELECT department_id`**

This part of the subquery retrieves the `department_id` value from the `departments` table.

#### 4. **`FROM departments`**

This indicates that the `department_id` will be selected from the `departments` table.

#### 5. **`WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'`**

This condition filters the `departments` table to find the row where `department_name` is 'Engineering'. The subquery returns the `department_id` for the 'Engineering' department.

#### 6. **`)`**

This closes the subquery that provides the new value for `department_id`.

#### 7. **`WHERE job_title = 'Engineer'`**

This condition specifies that the update should only apply to employees whose `job_title` is 'Engineer'.

#### 8. **`AND department_id != (`**

This condition ensures that the `department_id` is only updated if the current `department_id` is not the one associated with 'Engineering'. It includes another subquery to determine the current value.

#### 9. **`SELECT department_id`**

This subquery retrieves the `department_id` from the `departments` table.

#### 10. **`FROM departments`**

Specifies that the `department_id` should be selected from the `departments` table.

#### 11. **`WHERE department_name = 'Engineering'`**

Filters the `departments` table to find the `department_id` for the 'Engineering' department. This value is used to ensure that only employees who are not already in the 'Engineering' department will be updated.

#### 12. **`)`**

This closes the subquery that checks the current `department_id`.

### Summary

In summary, this query updates the `department_id` of all employees with the job title 'Engineer' who are not currently assigned to the 'Engineering' department. It sets their `department_id` to the ID of the 'Engineering' department.

### Example

Assume you have the following data:

- `departments` table:
  - `department_id = 1`, `department_name = 'Engineering'`
  - `department_id = 2`, `department_name = 'Sales'`

- `employees` table:
  - `employee_id = 100`, `job_title = 'Engineer'`, `department_id = 2` (currently in Sales)

After executing the query, the employee with `employee_id = 100` would have their `department_id` updated from 2 (Sales) to 1 (Engineering), correcting their department based on their job title.
